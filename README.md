## [^](#welcome) Business 



+ **Concept**:
  1. Business:
      >Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit.
    2. Business Process and Workflow:
        >Business processes is a sequence of activities (subdivided into tasks) ordered in a logical way, with cause and effect relations between them, and with the objective of delivering a product, service, information, decision or other output to an internal or external customer.
        
        >Workflow is a set of technologies and tools that enable documents, information, activities and tasks to flow appropriately in the company, or department of a company.
    3. Business Process and Workflow Difference:
        >Process is a sequence of tasks, workflow is a way to make this sequence more productive and efficient
        
        >Process is something that exists naturally and flows intuitively. A workflow is analyzed, planned, modeled and automated consciously and with well-defined purposes
        
        >Process is the way a team coordinates and communicates to deliver a result. Workflow is a technology or tool that can help to do achieve this result in the best way.
        
        >Not every process is automated, the goal of workflow software is actually to automate processes
        
        >Workflow is a consequence of the existence of processes, so it’s possible for a process to exist without workflow. Conversely a workflow cannot exist without the corresponding process.
    4. Activity:
        >An activity is a major unit of work to be completed in achieving the objectives of a process. An activity has precise starting and ending dates, incorporates a set of tasks to be completed, consumes resources, and results in work products. An activity may have a precedence relationship with other activities.
    5. Task:
        >A BPMN task is an atomic activity within a process flow. You create a task when the activity cannot be broken down to a finer level of detail.
    6. BPM(Business process modeling):
        >Business process modeling (BPM) in business process management and systems engineering is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be analysed, improved, and automated. BPM is typically performed by business analysts, who provide expertise in the modeling discipline.
    7. BPMN:
        >Business Process Model and Notation is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. Business Process Management Initiative developed BPMN, which has been maintained by the Object Management Group since the two organizations merged in 2005.
    8. BPMS:
        >BPMS is a software tool used to improve an organization's business processes through the definition, automation, and analysis of business processes.
    9. BPEL:
        >The Web Services Business Process Execution Language, commonly known as BPEL, is an OASIS standard executable language for specifying actions within business processes with web services. Processes in BPEL export and import information by using web service interfaces exclusively.
    10. Earned Value:
        >Earned Value is an approach where you monitor the project plan, actual work, and work completed _value_ to see if a project is on track. Earned Value shows how much of the budget and time should have been spent, considering the amount of work done so far.

+ **Tools**: 
    1. Bizagi Modeler:
        >Bizagi Modeler is a BPMN process modeling software that facilitates the creation and implementation of flowcharts and workflows.
    2. ActiveVOS:
        >ActiveVOS is a service oriented process automation platform. In ActiveVOS, you can quickly create BPMN2.0 compliant process models that seamlessly integrate people, processes and systems, increasing the efficiency and visibility of your business.
    3. Sharepoint:
        >SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.


## [^](#welcome) Project
+ **Concept**:
    1. PMBOK:
        >PMBOK stands for Project Management Body of Knowledge and it is the entire collection of processes, best practices, terminologies, and guidelines that are accepted as standards within the project management industry.
    2. Project (According to PMBOK):
        >A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end.
    3. Project Phases (According to PMBOK):
        >***Initiating***:  The project is authorized, funded and defined.  This phase occurs on the organizational level (i.e. above the project).  The organization defines a business need the project is meant to satisfy.
        
        >***Planning***:  The project manager develops a project management plan, which defines how the project will be carried out, who will do the work, how long it will take, and so forth.  The project management plan must be approved by the project sponsor to become official, and changes must be re-approved according to the change management processes described therein.
        
        >***Execution***:  The project team gets to work producing the project’s deliverables.
        
        >***Monitoring & Controlling***:  The project manager ensures that the work is carried out according to the plan, and tracks deviations using earned value analysis for schedule and cost, as will as monitoring the scope, communications, vendors, and any other item necessary to ensure the project goes according to plan.
        
        >***Closing***:  The project must be officially closed, final details determined, vendors released, and so forth.
        
    4. Project Knowledge Areas (According to PMBOK):
        >***Project Integration Management***: 
        
        >***Project Scope Management***: 
        
        >***Project Schedule Management***:

        >***Project Risk Management***: 
        
        >***Project Procurement Management***: 
        
        >***Project Stakeholder Management***: 

    5. WBS (According to PMBOK):
        >Work breakdown structure is a deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work that can be executed by the project team.
    6. ERP:
        >ERP is usually referred to as a category of business management software — typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many business activities.
        
+ **Tools**: 
    1. Primavera:
        >Primavera is an enterprise project portfolio management software. It includes project management, product management, collaboration and control capabilities, and integrates with other enterprise software such as Oracle and SAP’s ERP systems. Primavera was launched in 1983 by Primavera Systems Inc., which was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2008
    2. MS Project:

    3. SAP ERP:
        >SAP ERP is an enterprise resource planning software developed by the German company SAP SE

## [^](#welcome) Architecture
+ **Concept**:
  1. Software Architecture:
        >a Software Architecture can contain several architectural styles, and each architectural style can make use of several architectural patterns. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles)
         
  2. Software Architectural Style:
        >An Architectural Style is just a name given to a recurrent architectural design. Contrary to a pattern, it doesn't exist to "solve" a problem. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles)
         
  3. Software Architectural Pattern:
        >An Architectural Pattern is a way of solving a recurring architectural problem. MVC, for instance, solves the problem of separating the UI from the model. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958316/whats-the-difference-between-architectural-patterns-and-architectural-styles)
         
  4. Layer and Tier:
        >***Layer***: Logical layers are merely a way of organizing your code. Typical layers include Presentation, Business and Data – the same as the traditional 3-tier model. But when we’re talking about layers, we’re only talking about logical organization of code. In no way is it implied that these layers might run on different computers or in different processes on a single computer or even in a single process on a single computer. All we are doing is discussing a way of organizing a code into a set of layers defined by specific function.

        >***Tier***: Physical tiers, are only about where the code runs. Specifically, tiers are places where layers are deployed and where layers run. In other words, tiers are the physical deployment of layers.

+ **Software Architectural Styles:**:
  1. ***Structure Category>*** Component-based
        >Component-based software engineering (CBSE), also called components-based development (CBD), is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of concerns with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given software system. It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into systems. This practice aims to bring about an equally wide-ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term and the long-term for the software itself and for organizations that sponsor such software.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)

  2. ***Structure Category>*** Monolithic application
        >In software engineering, a monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application)

  3. ***Structure Category>*** Layered
        >The layered pattern is probably one of the most well-known software architecture patterns. Many developers use it, without really knowing its name. The idea is to split up your code into “layers”, where each layer has a certain responsibility and provides a service to a higher layer. There isn’t a predefined number of layers, but these are the ones you see most often:
         - Presentation or UI layer
         - Application layer
         - Business or domain layer
         - Persistence or data access layer
         - Database layer
          [https://dzone.com/articles/software-architecture-the-5-patterns-you-need-to-k](https://dzone.com/articles/software-architecture-the-5-patterns-you-need-to-k)
   
  4. ***Structure Category>*** Pipes and filters
        >The Pipe and Filter architecture is inspired by the Unix technique of connecting the output of an application to the input of another via pipes on the shell. The pipe and filter architecture consists of one or more data sources. The data source is connected to data filters via pipes.[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-with/9781786468529/ch08s04.html](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-with/9781786468529/ch08s04.html)

  5. ***Shared memory Category>*** Database-centric

  6. ***Shared memory Category>*** Blackboard

  7. ***Shared memory Category>*** Rule-based

  8. ***Messaging Category>*** Event-driven
        >This architecture depends on Event Producers and Event Consumers. The main idea is to decouple your system’s parts and each part will be triggered when an interesting event from another part has got triggered. Is it complicated? Let’s simplify it. Assume you design an online store system and it has two parts. A purchase module and a vendor module. If a customer makes a purchase, the purchase module would generate an event of “orderPending” Since the vendor module is interesting in the “orderPending” event, it will be listening, in case one is triggered. Once the vendor module gets this event, it will execute some tasks or maybe fire another event for order more of the product from a certain vendor.[https://codeburst.io/software-architecture-the-difference-between-architecture-and-design-7936abdd5830](https://codeburst.io/software-architecture-the-difference-between-architecture-and-design-7936abdd5830)
         
  9. ***Messaging Category>*** Publish-subscribe
        >In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
        
  10. ***Messaging Category>*** Asynchronous messaging

  11. ***Adaptive systems Category>*** Plug-ins
        >Provide a way to extend the capabilities of a software system by addition rather than modification. This can range from traditional plug-ins and add-ons to an architecture built almost entirely of plug-ins. [https://wiki.c2.com/?PluginArchitecture](https://wiki.c2.com/?PluginArchitecture)
        
  12. ***Adaptive systems Category>*** Microkernel
        >The microkernel pattern, or plug-in pattern, is useful when your application has a core set of responsibilities and a collection of interchangeable parts on the side. The microkernel will provide the entry point and the general flow of the application, without really knowing what the different plug-ins are doing.

  21. ***Distributed systems Category>*** Service-oriented Architecture (SOA)

  22. ***Distributed systems Category>*** Cloud computing

  23. Object-Oriented

  24. Resource-oriented Architecture (ROA)

  25. Message Bus

+ **Software Architectural Patterns:**:
  1. Three-tier

  2. Multilayered architecture

  3. Model-view-controller

  4. Domain Driven Design

  5. Microkernel

  6. Blackboard pattern

  7. Sensor-controller-actuator

  8. Presentation–abstraction–control

  9. Model-View-ViewModel
 
  10. CQRS

  11. Event Sourcing

  12. Microservice:
        >When you write your application as a set of microservices, you’re actually writing multiple applications that will work together. Each microservice has its own distinct responsibility and teams can develop them independently of other microservices. The only dependency between them is the communication. As microservices communicate with each other, you will have to make sure messages sent between them remain backwards-compatible. This requires some coordination, especially when different teams are responsible for different microservices.

## [^](#welcome) Design
+ **Concept**:
    1. DDD(Domain Driven Design):
        >DDD, is an approach to development that connects the implementation to an evolving model; placing the focus of the project on the core domain (sphere of knowledge), the logic behind it, and forces collaboration between technical and nontechnical parties to improve the model.
    2. TDD(Test Driven Development):
        >TDD, is a process of developing software where a test is written prior to writing code. Once that is done, developers will work towards writing just enough code to pass the test, and then begin refactoring.
    3. BDD(Behavioural Driven Development):
        >Behavioural Driven Development, or BDD, is a refinement of TDD and DDD that aims to streamline development through narrowing communication gaps, creating a better understanding of the customer, and allowing for continuous communication. Simply put, BDD is a way of combining business requirements with code and allows you to understand the behaviour of the system from a business/end-user perspective.
    4. UML: 
        >The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
    6. RUP:
        >Short for Rational Unified Process, a software development methodology from Rational. Based on UML, RUP organizes the development of software into four phases, each consisting of one or more executable iterations of the software at that stage of development

+ **Tools**: 
    1. Visual Paradigm:
        >Visual Paradigm is a UML CASE Tool supporting UML 2, SysML and Business Process Modeling Notation from the Object Management Group. In addition to modeling support, it provides report generation and code engineering capabilities including code generation.
    2. Microsoft Office:
        >Microsoft Office is a suite of desktop productivity applications that is designed specifically to be used for office or business use. It is a proprietary product of Microsoft Corporation and was first released in 1990.


## [^](#welcome) Development
+ **Concept**:
    1. Agile:
        >Agile methodology is a type of project management process, mainly used for software development, where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers.
    2. CI/CD:
        >CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA “integration hell”). Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the life-cycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment.
    3. Object-oriented programming:
        >Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.
    4. Clean Coding:
        >Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.
    5. Design Patterns:
        >A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
    6. Multithreading:
        >Multithreadingis the ability of a central processing unit to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. This approach differs from multiprocessing.
    7. Web Socket:
        >WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP
    8. Exception:
        >An exception is an abnormal or unprecedented event that occurs after the execution of a software program or application. It is a runtime error of an undesired result or event affecting normal program flow. An exception is also known as a fault.
    9. Interceptor:
        >Interceptors are used to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, auditing, and security, from the business logic. 
    10. JNDI:
        >The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is a Java API for a directory service that allows Java software clients to discover and look up data and resources (in the form of Java objects) via a name. Like all Java APIs that interface with host systems, JNDI is independent of the underlying implementation.
    11. Data Structure:
        >A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
    12. Web Service:
        >A Web service is a software service used to communicate between two devices on a network. More specifically, a Web service is a software application with a standardized way of providing interoperability between disparate applications. It does so over HTTP using technologies such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI.
    13. API:
        >An application programming interface is an interface or communication protocol between a client and a server intended to simplify the building of client-side software.
    14. Dependency Injection / Inversion Of Control:
        >Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.

        >Inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework.
    15. Reflection:
        >Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.
    16. Progressive web applications(PWA):
        >Progressive web applications are a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.
+ **Tools**: 
    1. Java 8 to 13 Features:
        >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history
    2. JavaEE , J2EE , Jakarta:
        >Java Enterprise Edition, formerly Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, currently rebranded as Jakarta EE, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE 8 with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition
    3. Spring (Spring / Spring Boot) Framework:
        >Spring Boot is an opinionated instance of a Spring application. Spring Boot is a rapid application development platform. It uses various components of Spring, but has additional niceties like the ability to package your application as a runnable jar, which includes an embedded tomcat (or jetty) server.
    4. Kotlin:
        >Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise
    5. Glue:
        >Glue is a Python library to explore relationships within and between related datasets


## [^](#welcome) Software Configuration Management (SCM)
+ **Concept**:
     1. Version Control:
          >A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.
     2. Build Number:
          >executable or a library created by compiling source code. Build #465832567 is just the number of times the main developer compiled the program (or library). Sensible developers only release builds with meaningful and tested changes.
     3. Version:
          >A software build. New version is a different build. Version 2.1.5 means it's the second edition with at least 1 major difference from its 2.0.~ predecessors and 5 minor feature updates or bug fixes.
     4. Release (Public Release):
          >A version intended for use by general population. "Public release" usually means it's a version for normal users who are not involved in testing or development of the software.
     5. Stages of Development:
          >***Pre-alpha***: Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include requirements analysis, software design, software development, and unit testing. In typical open source development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. Milestone versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.

          >***Alpha***: The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing. In this phase, developers generally test the software using white-box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black-box or gray-box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release. Alpha software is software that is not thoroughly tested by the developer before it is released to customers. Alpha software may contain serious errors, and any resulting instability could cause crashes or data loss

          >***Beta***: Software in the beta stage is also known as betaware. Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can either be public or private, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers.

          >***Perpetual Beta***: Some software is kept in so-called perpetual beta, where new features are continually added to the software without establishing a final "stable" release. As the Internet has facilitated rapid and inexpensive distribution of software, companies have begun to take a looser approach to use of the word "beta". In February 2005, ZDNet published an article about the phenomenon of a beta version often staying for years and being used as if it were in production level. It noted that Gmail and Google News, for example, had been in beta for a long time although widely used; Google News did leave beta in January 2006, followed by Google Apps, including Gmail, in July 2009. This technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues.
    
          >***Open and Closed Beta***: Developers may release either a closed beta also called private beta, or an open beta also called public beta; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. Private beta could be suitable for the software that is capable to deliver value, but is not ready to be used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version.
       
          >***Release Candidate***: A release candidate (RC), also known as "going silver", is a beta version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called code complete when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral code for test cases or utilities.
     6. Release Life Cycle:
          >***Release to Manufacturing (RTM)*** :  The term release to manufacturing (RTM), also known as "going gold", is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be digitally signed, allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software purchase. A copy of the RTM build known as the "gold master" or GM is sent for mass duplication if applicable. RTM precedes general availability (GA) when the product is released to the public.
          
          >***General Availability (GA)*** :  General availability (GA) is the marketing stage at which all necessary commercialization activities have been completed and a software product is available for purchase, depending, however, on language, region, electronic vs. media availability.
          
          >***Release to Web (RTW)*** :  Release to the web (RTW) or web release is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution. No physical media are produced in this type of release mechanism by the manufacturer. Web releases are becoming more common as Internet usage grows.

     7. GIT Concepts:
          >***Branching*** : Branching, in version control and software configuration management, is the duplication of an object under version control (such as a source code file or a directory tree) so that modifications can occur in parallel along multiple branches. The default branch name in Git is 'master' branch 
          
          >***Clone*** : Clone is for fetching repositories you don't have, checkout is for switching between branches in a repository you already have.
          
          >***Fetch and Pull*** :  fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository. Pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
          
          >***Add to stage*** :  To stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit.
          
          >***Commit*** :  The "commit" command is used to save your changes from stage to the local repository.
          
          >***Push*** :  The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
          
          >***Conflict*** : A conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
          
          >***Reverse*** :  Revert some existing commits.
          
          >***Merge and Rebase*** :   Merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch. In this process, only the target branch is changed. The source branch history remains the same. Rebase is another way to integrate changes from one branch to another. Rebase compresses all the changes into a single “patch.” Then it integrates the patch onto the target branch. Unlike merging, rebasing flattens the history because it transfers the completed work from one branch to another. In the process, unwanted history is eliminated.
          
+ **Tools**: 
     1. GIT(Enterprise GitHub): 
        >GIT is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
     2. Apache Subversion: 
        >Apache Subversion is a software versioning and revision control system distributed as open source under the Apache License. Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation.
     3. Team Foundation Version Control: 
        >TFVC is a centralized version control system allowing teams to store any type of artifact within its repository. TFVC supports two different types of workspaces when working with client tools - Server Workspaces and Local Workspaces. Server workspaces allow developers to lock files for check-out and provide notification to other developers that files are being edited. A frequent complaint for this model is that files on the development machine are marked as read-only. It also requires developers to "go offline" when the server can't be contacted. Local workspaces were designed to avoid these problems. In a local workspace scenario files are not read-only and they do not have to be checked out before working on them. As long as the files are on the developer's local machine, it doesn't matter if the server is connected or not. Conflicts are dealt with at check-in time.
    4. Bitbucket:
         >Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Bitbucket offers both commercial plans and free accounts.
                
## [^](#welcome) Build Automation
+ **Concept**:
     1. Maven Repository:
         >In Maven terminology, a repository is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily.Maven repository are of three types. The following illustration will give an idea regarding these three types.local,central,remote.

         >***Local Repository***: Maven local repository is a folder location on your machine. It gets created when you run any maven command for the first time.

         >***Central Repository***: Maven central repository is repository provided by Maven community. It contains a large number of commonly used libraries. When Maven does not find any dependency in local repository, it starts searching in central repository

         >***Remote Repository***: Sometimes, Maven does not find a mentioned dependency in central repository as well. It then stops the build process and output error message to console. To prevent such situation, Maven provides concept of Remote Repository, which is developer's own custom repository containing required libraries or other project jars.
         
     3. Maven Dependency Management: 
         >Dependency management is a core feature of Maven. Managing dependencies for a single project is easy. Managing dependencies for multi-module projects and applications that consist of hundreds of modules is possible. Maven helps a great deal in defining, creating, and maintaining reproducible builds with well-defined classpaths and library versions.
         
+ **Tools**: 
     1. Apache Maven:
          >Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second, it describes its dependencies.
     2. Gradle:
          >Gradle is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.


## [^](#welcome) ORM and Databases
+ **Concept**:
     1. JPA:
          >The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database. JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification.
     2. ORM:
          >Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm
     2. Database Transaction:
          >A transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database.
     3. Database Session:
          >A session represents the connection between an application and the relational database that stores its persistent objects. TopLink provides several different session objects that all implement the same Session interface.
     4. Transaction Isolation Level:
          >Isolation levels define the degree to which a transaction must be isolated from the data modifications made by any other transaction in the database system.
     5. Transaction Rollback:
          >A rollback is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database integrity, because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any transaction which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state
     6. Join Table:
          >In the join table, match fields are foreign keys. These foreign key fields are populated with data as records in the join table are created from either table it joins
     7. Primary Key:
          >A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. A primary key's main features are: It must contain a unique value for each row of data. It cannot contain null values.
     8. Foreign Key:
          >A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.
     9. Unique Field(s):
          >A unique key is a set of one or more than one fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in a database table
     10. Relations:
          >Using foreign keys, or other candidate keys, you can implement three types of relationships between tables:

          >One-to-one: This type of relationship allows only one record on each side of the relationship. The primary key relates to only one record—or none—in another table. For example, in a marriage, each spouse has only one other spouse. This kind of relationship can be implemented in a single table and therefore does not use a foreign key.

          >One-to-many: A one-to-many relationship allows a single record in one table to be related to multiple records in another table. Consider a business with a database that has Customers and Orders tables.A single customer can purchase multiple orders, but a single order could not be linked to multiple customers. Therefore the Orders table would contain a foreign key that matched the primary key of the Customers table, while the Customers table would have no foreign key pointing to the Orders table.


          >Many-to-many: This is a complex relationship in which many records in a table can link to many records in another table. For example, our business probably needs not only Customers and Orders tables, but likely also needs a Products table.Again, the relationship between the Customers and Orders table is one-to-many, but consider the relationship between the Orders and Products table. An order can contain multiple products, and a product could be linked to multiple orders: several customers might submit an order that contains some of the same products. This kind of relationship requires at minimum three tables. 

     11. Lazy Loading / Eager loading:
          >Lazy loading is used to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used. The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading. This makes it ideal in use cases where network content is accessed and initialization times are to be kept at a minimum
     12. Entity:
          >Entity is a thing, person, place, unit, object or any item about which the data should be captured and stored in the form of properties, workflow and tables
     13. Proxy Objects:

          
+ **Tools**: 
     1. Mysql JPA Config:
          >MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
     2. MariaDB JPA Config:
          >MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.
     3. Oracle JPA Config:
          >Oracle Database is a proprietary multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation. It is a database commonly used for running online transaction processing, data warehousing and mixed database workloads.

## [^](#welcome) Security
+ **Concept**:
    1. AAA:
        >Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a term for a framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the information necessary to bill for services.
        
        >**Authentication**: Authentication provides a way of identifying a user, typically by having the user enter a valid user name and valid password before access is granted. The process of authentication is based on each user having a unique set of criteria for gaining access. The AAA server compares a user's authentication credentials with other user credentials stored in a database. If the credentials match, the user is granted access to the network. If the credentials are at variance, authentication fails and network access is denied.
        
        >**Authorization**: Following authentication, a user must gain authorization for doing certain tasks. After logging into a system, for instance, the user may try to issue commands. The authorization process determines whether the user has the authority to issue such commands. Simply put, authorization is the process of enforcing policies: determining what types or qualities of activities, resources, or services a user is permitted. Usually, authorization occurs within the context of authentication. Once you have authenticated a user, they may be authorized for different types of access or activity.
        
        >**Accounting**: The final plank in the AAA framework is accounting, which measures the resources a user consumes during access. This can include the amount of system time or the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during a session. Accounting is carried out by logging of session statistics and usage information and is used for authorization control, billing, trend analysis, resource utilization, and capacity planning activities.
        
    2. Authentication by HTTP Session:
        >**HTTP sessions** is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application. https://documentation.progress.com/output/ua/OpenEdge_latest/pasoe-admin/overview-of-http-sessions.html
        
    3. Authentication by Token:
        >A web authentication technique that lets users enter their username and password once and receive a uniquely-generated encrypted token in exchange. This token is then used to access protected pages or resources instead of the login credentials for a designated period of time.
        
        >**OAuth2**: OAuth2 is, you guessed it, the version 2 of the OAuth protocol (also called framework). This protocol allows third-party applications to grant limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
        
        >**JWT**: JSON Web Token is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
    
    4. Captcha:
        >A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge–response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human. The term was coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. The most common type of CAPTCHA was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel.

    5. SQL Injection:
        >SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).[1] SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.

    6. Cross-site scripting (XSS):
        >Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in another user's browser. The attacker does not directly target his victim. Instead, he exploits a vulnerability in a website that the victim visits, in order to get the website to deliver the malicious JavaScript for him. To the victim's browser, the malicious JavaScript appears to be a legitimate part of the website, and the website has thus acted as an unintentional accomplice to the attacker. [https://excess-xss.com/](https://excess-xss.com/)
        
        >**Cookie theft**: The attacker can access the victim's cookies associated with the website using `document.cookie`, send them to his own server, and use them to extract sensitive information like session IDs.
        
        >**Keylogging**: The attacker can register a keyboard event listener using `addEventListener` and then send all of the user's keystrokes to his own server, potentially recording sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

        >**Phishing**: The attacker can insert a fake login form into the page using DOM manipulation, set the form's `action` attribute to target his own server, and then trick the user into submitting sensitive information.
      
        >**Types of XSS**: Persistent XSS(where the malicious string originates from the website's database.) ,Reflected XSS(where the malicious string originates from the victim's request.)DOM-based XSS(where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.)
          
    7. Cross-site Request Forgery/One-click Attack/Session Riding (CSRF or XSRF):
        >Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.

## [^](#welcome) Application Servers
+ **Concept**:
    1. JAR:
        >A JAR is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources into one file for distribution. It is used to store classes of java created by the user in order to help the runnable and inference concepts embedded within the language.
    2. WAR:
        >A WAR file is an archive that contains all the parts of a web application: Java class files for servlets and web services, JSPs, HTML pages, images, and other resources. The WAR file is simply a JAR file (which is itself a fancy ZIP file) with specified directories for the Java code and one designated configuration file: the web.xml file, which tells the application server what to run and how to run it. WAR files always have the extension .war, but they can be created and read with the standard jar tool.
    3. JAR and WAR Difference:
        >A .war file is a Web Application Archive which runs inside an application server while a .jar is Java Application Archive that runs a desktop application on a user's machine. A war file is a special jar file that is used to package a web application to make it easy to deploy it on an application server.
    3. WAR Deployment:
        >When deployed, the name of the WAR becomes, by default, the root path of the web application. for example for "shoppingcart.war" with "index.html" and "WEB-INF/web.xml" and "WEB-INF/classes/com/PurchaseServlet.class" and "WEB-INF/lib/thirdparty.jar" files , the base URL for this web app, if deployed on http://www.oreilly.com, is http://www.oreilly.com/shoppingcart/, and all references to its documents, images, and servlets start with that path. The top level of the WAR file becomes the document root (base directory) for serving files. Our index.html file appears at the base URL we just mentioned. The _WEB-INF_ directory (all caps, hyphenated) is a special directory that contains all deployment information and application code. This directory is protected by the web server, and its contents are not visible to outside users of the application, even if you add _WEB-INF_ to the base URL. Your application classes can load additional files from this area using `getResource()` on the servlet context, however, so it is a safe place to store application resources.

Enterprise teams with a need for global infrastructure to support DevOps at Scale can build a strong foundation using IaC with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Infrastructure as Code is the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure. This includes servers, networking, load balancing, and security. Using software instead of physical hardware has major benefits.
+ **Tools**: 
     1. Docker:
        >Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
    2. Kubernetes:
        >Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
    3. Ansible:
        >Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.
    4. Bamboo:
        >Bamboo is a continuous integration and continuous deployment server developed by Atlassian. Although initially available both as an on-premises and cloud computing service, in May 2016 it was announced that the cloud version would be discontinued by end of January 2017.
    5. Confluence:
        >Confluence is a collaboration software program developed and published by Australian software company Atlassian.
    6. Jira:
        >JIRA is a tool developed by Atlassian which is an Australian Company. The main purpose of Jira is to track bug, track related issue, and it is used for project management. Jira is designed for project management in an agile way and that is the reason for which most of the official documentation is written with this.



## [^](#welcome) Middleware Systems
+ **Concept**:
     1. Message Broker:
        >A message broker is an architectural pattern for message validation, transformation, and routing. It mediates communication among applications, minimizing the mutual awareness that applications should have of each other in order to be able to exchange messages, effectively implementing decoupling.
        
+ **Tools**: 
    1. Apache Kafka:
        >Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds
    2. RabbitMQ:
        >RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.
    3. Apache Camel:
        >Apache Camel is an open source framework for message-oriented middleware with a rule-based routing and mediation engine that provides a Java object-based implementation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an application programming interface to configure routing and mediation rules
    4. Apache ActiveMQ:
        >Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with a full Java Message Service client. It provides "Enterprise Features" which in this case means fostering the communication from more than one client or server.
